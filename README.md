Here is a documentation for the provided Python code which uses Streamlit and OpenAI for generating and conducting quizzes:

### Code Overview
This script creates an AI-powered quiz generator web application using Streamlit and OpenAI. Users can specify a topic and the number of questions, and the app generates a quiz based on these inputs. The quiz is dynamically created using OpenAI's GPT model.

### Key Components

#### Imports
- `streamlit as st`: Used for creating the web app interface.
- `openai`: Used for accessing the OpenAI GPT model to generate quiz questions.

#### OpenAI API Key Initialization
- `openai.api_key`: Sets the API key for accessing OpenAI's services.

#### Function: `generate_quiz(topic, num_questions)`
- Generates a quiz based on the specified topic and number of questions.
- Returns two lists: `questions` (quiz questions) and `correct_answers` (correct answers for each question).

#### Streamlit Session State Initialization
- Initializes session state variables to store quiz questions, user answers, correct answers, and submission status.

#### Streamlit App Interface
- Sets up the user interface for the quiz generator.
- Includes input fields for the quiz topic and number of questions.
- Features a 'Generate Quiz' button to start quiz generation.

#### Quiz Generation Logic
- Upon clicking 'Generate Quiz', the app calls `generate_quiz` to generate the quiz questions and answers.
- The questions and corresponding multiple-choice options are displayed on the interface.

#### Answer Submission and Validation
- Provides radio buttons for each question for the user to select their answers.
- Includes a 'Submit Quiz' button, which becomes active once all questions are answered.
- The `check_answers()` function compares user answers with correct answers, calculates the score, and displays it along with the correct answers for each question.

#### Error Handling
- If not all questions are answered, a warning is displayed, and the quiz cannot be submitted.

### How to Use
1. Run the script using a Streamlit server.
2. Enter the desired quiz topic and number of questions in the provided fields.
3. Click 'Generate Quiz' to display the quiz.
4. Answer the quiz questions.
5. Click 'Submit Quiz' to view your score and the correct answers.

### Dependencies
- Streamlit
- OpenAI's Python package

### Note
- The API key for OpenAI should be kept confidential and secure.
- The code dynamically generates unique questions for each quiz, ensuring a varied experience each time.
